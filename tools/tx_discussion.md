## TX state discussion

### 1. Swap
#### a) Single pool swap (with Rune)

- `1 blast from Wallet to Pool`
- `Orbit arount while pending`
- `Consumed by pool`
- `Emit 1 or more TX (out coins) from Pool to Wallet (may be add affiliate wallet support)`

### 2. Add liquidity (and Donate as well)

- `2 blasts from Wallet to Pool`
- `Orbit around each other`
- `Orbit around pool while pending`
- `Consumed by pool`

### 3. Withdraw liquidity

- `1 small quick blast (intention to withdraw)`
- `Orbit around pool while pending`
- `1 or 2 or more out blasts from Pool to Wallets`

### 4. Refund

- `1 (more possible?) tx from Wallet to Pool/Core`
- `Repel (not consume)`
- 'send them back to wallets'

Question?
How repel force work?

// E.g. f(t) = ease ?
